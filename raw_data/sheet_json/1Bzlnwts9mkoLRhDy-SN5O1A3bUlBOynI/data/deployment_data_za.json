Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The @global.app_name_full team cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you do not have access to Wi-Fi, or you do not have any of your data allowance left.\n\n2. Using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, will mean that your terms of agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.\n\n3. Although we endeavour to ensure that the app is updated and its content accurate, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. We do not regularly review all of the external sites and cannot guarantee that they are always accurate or reliable.\n\n4. The @global.app_name_full team accepts no liability for any damage or loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of using the app, or arising from any reliance you may place on advice or information provided from the app. You should always exercise your own discretion and judgment appropriate to your own circumstances in relation to any advice or information provided from the app.\n\n5. We are devoid of any responsibility for any instances of software bugs, viruses or other malicious material transmitted by a third party through our site.\n\n6. Updates to the app occur regularly in order to improve performance and content, to adapt to new technologies, to prevent abuse or harm, to address legal, regulatory, safety, or security issues or for any other further need. The app is available on Android and Apple -- the requirements for this system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change. It is your responsibility to download app updates to keep using the app. The @global.app_name_full team does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the operating system version that you have installed on your device. However, you agree to always accept updates to the application when offered to you.\n\n7. The app site might not be available at all times for reasons of maintenance or trouble with associated software or hardware. We are not liable for any loss you may incur should the site not be accessible or is withdrawn. Equally, we have the right and choice to terminate your access and use of the app (including availability of captured data) at any time. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.\n\n8. You agree to indemnify, at your own expense, PLH, its officials, employees, consultants and agents, against any claims, including your costs and expenses, by any third party, resulting from your use of the app.\n\n9.
