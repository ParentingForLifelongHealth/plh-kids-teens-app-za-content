Today, we’ll explore how cooking can help your child learn maths while bonding together.\nStart by inviting your child to help prepare a snack, like making a pizza or a colourful fruit salad. As you gather the ingredients, ask them to count: 'How many grapes do we have?' This builds maths skills and encourages teamwork.\nNext, involve them in addition and subtraction: 'We need five grapes, if we have three, how many more do we need?' This makes learning fun!\nLet’s make it playful! Ask, 'Which is bigger: the grape or the apple?' This reinforces comparison skills.\nConsider planning a weekly cooking night. Cooking strengthens your relationship and builds your child’s confidence. Enjoy your cooking adventure together!",

This activity is perfect for sparking creativity while building your problem-solving and teamwork skills!\nHere’s what you’ll need: Ruler, pencil, clothes hangers (plastic preferably), string, scissors, and then light objects to decorate your balance.\nHere’s how to start:\nFirst, experiment with balance. Place a ruler over a pencil to create a simple see-saw. Try balancing different objects on each end. How much weight does it take to tip the balance?\nNext, challenge yourself further! Start with one hanger and slowly start hanging other hangers on either end of the first hanger. Now try hanging two more hangers from each hanger in the second tier. Remember to try to maintain balance between each of the hangers! See how many you can balance before they tumble down. It’s all about finding the right balance point.\nNow that you’ve mastered balancing, it’s time to get creative! Think about the kind of balance you want to make. What materials will you use? What objects will hang from it? Gather materials like wire and thread, to form the structure of your balance.\nFor the fun part, choose the items to hang. You can use anything—folded paper shapes, drawings, small objects from around the house, or whatever inspires you.\nFinally, start building and balancing! Experiment with different placements to keep everything steady and enjoy the process of creating a beautiful, gravity-defying piece of art.\nThis activity is a fun and creative way to learn about balance and teamwork while letting your imagination run wild.

This can be as serious or silly as you want it to be.\nOnce the first part of the drawing is complete, fold the 2–3 inch column of artwork back, concealing what has been drawn but leaving two lines to demarcate where the next person who is drawing should pick up.\nPass the paper on to the next person, who, without seeing what has already been drawn, will contribute the next set of features to the character: The shoulders or torso. Fold the paper back to conceal the image and pass it on.\nRepeat until someone has drawn the feet of the character and then open your drawing up to see the masterpiece you have collaboratively created!\nThis game builds creativity, nurtures imagination, and helps teach kids to collaborate!

Here is a way you can help your teen set new goals for the things they want to achieve. 👑\n\n👑 Ask your teen to come up with three things that they are good at, and discuss what they did to become so good at them. For example: keeping their room neat, helping your family with housework, or playing a sport.\n\n🏆 Next, ask your teen what they wish they were good at. \n\n🔑 Remind them that it took work and practice to become good at the skills they have. They will have to do the same for any new goal.\n\n⏰ Help your teen break down their goal and set up smaller goals they need to achieve to reach their greater goal. \n\n📝 It is much easier to achieve a goal if you write it down! This way, you can be reminded of it as you work towards it.\n\n☀️ For example, if the goal is to be good at football, small weekly goals could be to go to football practice 2 times per week, run at least 1 km 5 times per week, and learn about the sport from other football players in the community or from books or videos they find. \n\n✅ It is important to write down these smaller goals and let your teen tick off each task as they do them each week. Seeing themselves reach smaller goals will keep them motivated to achieve the big goal!",
