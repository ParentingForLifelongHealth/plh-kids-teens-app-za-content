Today, we’ll explore how cooking can help your child learn maths while bonding together.\nStart by inviting your child to help prepare a snack, like making a pizza or a colourful fruit salad. As you gather the ingredients, ask them to count: 'How many grapes do we have?' This builds maths skills and encourages teamwork.\nNext, involve them in addition and subtraction: 'We need five grapes, if we have three, how many more do we need?' This makes learning fun!\nLet’s make it playful! Ask, 'Which is bigger: the grape or the apple?' This reinforces comparison skills.\nConsider planning a weekly cooking night. Cooking strengthens your relationship and builds your child’s confidence. Enjoy your cooking adventure together!",

You have unlocked a new play activity: Leader Says!\nThis classic game is a great way to help your child build listening skills, focus on following directions, and have fun at the same time! Here’s how you can play together:\nOne of you will take the role of the Leader, giving commands to the other. But there’s a fun twist! Your child should only follow the command if it starts with “Leader says”. For example, if you say, “Leader says jump\", they should jump. But if you just say “Jump” without the “Leader says” part, they shouldn’t move!\nEncourage your child to listen carefully and respond only when they hear “Leader says\". If they follow a command without it, gently remind them to pay attention and keep going for the next round.\nNow it’s time to switch roles! Let your child be Leader and give you the commands. \nThis playful activity is a wonderful way to practise listening, self-control, and quick thinking—perfect for getting your child engaged while learning important skills. Enjoy the fun of Leader Says together!"

You have unlocked a new play activity: Raise The Bottles!\nGet ready to have some outdoor fun while testing your teamwork and coordination in this fast-paced bottle game!\nHere’s how to play: Start by dividing the players into two teams. Team A should have at least two people, while team B can be just one person.\nNext, set up three plastic bottles in a line with plenty of space between them. You can add more bottles later for extra challenge!\nMark two lines on either side of the bottles, where team A will stand. It’s up to you how far these lines should be from the bottles—make it challenging, but fair!\nNow, it’s game time! Team A stands behind their lines and tries to knock the bottles over using a soft ball, while Team B rushes to stand the bottles back up as quickly as possible.\nBefore you begin, decide how long each game will last—about three minutes is a good starting point.\nIf Team A manages to knock all the bottles down at the same time during those three minutes, they win! If Team B successfully keeps the bottles standing, they are the winners.\nSo, grab some bottles, a ball, and some friends, and get moving with this exciting outdoor challenge!",

Remember to try to maintain balance between each of the hangers! See how many you can balance before they tumble down. It’s all about finding the right balance point.\nNow that you’ve mastered balancing, it’s time to get creative! Think about the kind of balance you want to make. What materials will you use? What objects will hang from it? Gather materials like wire and thread, to form the structure of your balance.\nFor the fun part, choose the items to hang. You can use anything—folded paper shapes, drawings, small objects from around the house, or whatever inspires you.\nFinally, start building and balancing! Experiment with different placements to keep everything steady and enjoy the process of creating a beautiful, gravity-defying piece of art.\nThis activity is a fun and creative way to learn about balance and teamwork while letting your imagination run wild.
