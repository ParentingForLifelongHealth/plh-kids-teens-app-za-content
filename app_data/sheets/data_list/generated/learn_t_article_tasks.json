Here are some fun activity ideas from other parents:\n\n**Music and dance:**\n- Dancing is a fun way to get exercise, and a great way to learn about your teen’s interests.\n- Tip: Let your teen show you music and dance moves. And don't take it too seriously, be silly and have fun together.\n**Check-in chat:**\n- Ask each other, “What made you happy today?”\n- Ask each other, “What difficulty did you face today?”\n- Ask each other, “How can I help you?”\n- Try to do this together every day; it could be when you are eating dinner together or before you go to bed.",
