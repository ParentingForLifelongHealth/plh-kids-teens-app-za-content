It could be anything - a friend, a favourite pet, an activity that made you smile.\n\n👀 Next, find three things that represent what makes you happy and place them in a special container or box. \n\n🎨 If the things that make you happy are too big to fit in the box, or if you can’t find something to represent them, you can draw them!\n\n👂 Once everything is in the box, discuss what you and your child chose. Ask them why these things make them happy. It’s a great way to get them talking about positive emotions.\n\nYou can play this game as often as you like - even daily! Doing this before bed can help your child stay motivated, happy, and calm, especially during tough times.\nSo, gather those happy things and create a special box full of joy! ⭐\n\nAdapted from Learning Through Play: https://learningthroughplay.com/let-s-play/things-that-make-me-happy",

For example, washing up, sweeping, mopping, making the beds, and laundry.\n\n🔄 Each week, let a different person in the family choose a chore first.\n\n🎵 Play some music or turn on the radio. Music is a great way to make a boring task fun!\n\n✅ Tick off the tasks when they are done so you can see your progress as a family. You could offer small rewards as motivation to complete activities.\n\n📺 For example, you could let your teen watch more TV, spend more time with their friends, choose what they want for dinner, or have something sweet if they do their chores in a fair amount of time.\n\n❓ If your child does not complete a chore, ask them why, and come up with a fair consequence together.",
