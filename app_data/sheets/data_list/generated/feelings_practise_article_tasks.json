She would shout and scream, even when we went out, and I would also feel very angry and embarrassed. \n\nWhen I learned about emotions, I started to name and acknowledge her emotions. I helped her understand that it is okay to feel angry sometimes, but that she can show it in a different way. Now, she will tell me when she starts to feel angry, and we can find a solution together that works for everyone.",
