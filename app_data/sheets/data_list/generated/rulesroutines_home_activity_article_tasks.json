You know you have to be ready for school early in the morning!”. Some days I was just too tired, and I would let them watch more TV. \n\nWhen we learned in @global.app_name about rules, I learned that it is important to be consistent. I discussed with my children why watching TV till late is a problem, and we came up with a rule together to switch off the TV at 8 and be ready for bed by 8.30. Now everyone knows what is expected of them, and we can end the day peacefully.",
