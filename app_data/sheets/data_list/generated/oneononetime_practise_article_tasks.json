I did not want to spoil my daughter so that she thinks we have to do everything together. \n\rBut I really wanted to build my relationship with her and I wanted her to open up about what was troubling her. \n\rSo we tried the One-on-One Time. \n\rFirst, it felt weird, but it turned out to be fun! Now we play her favourite game together and talk about things happening at school and with her friends."
