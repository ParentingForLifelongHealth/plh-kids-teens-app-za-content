Notice any discomfort or tension.\nConnect to your heart in a kind and gentle way. You may want to place one hand on your heart or chest. \nYou can then say the following words silently to yourself: \nMay I be peaceful. \nMay I be safe. \nMay I be healthy. \nMay I be happy. \nMay I feel loved. \nRepeat slowly once or twice, taking your time between each phrase.\nIf you feel comfortable, you can also send thoughts of loving-kindness to your child, your partner, your family, and anyone else who is close to you in your life.\nNow, allow your focus to expand to the whole body. \nAllow your focus to expand to the sounds in the room. \nTake a moment to reflect on whether you feel any different. \nOpen your eyes, and when you are ready, continue to your lesson with a sense of calm. \nThank you for taking a moment to pause with us."
