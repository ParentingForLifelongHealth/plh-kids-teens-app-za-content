You can put a hand on your stomach and feel it rise and fall with each breath. Do this for about 10 breaths.\n\nStep 4. Expand your awareness to your whole body. Listen to the sounds in the room. \n\nStep 5. Take a moment to reflect on whether you feel any different. When you are ready, open your eyes.\n\nWell done for taking a pause. You can do this anytime you are feeling stressed. It gives you a chance to be calmer. Even a few deep breaths or connecting with the ground beneath you can make a difference. You can also take a pause with your children!"
