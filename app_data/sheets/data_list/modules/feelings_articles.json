Each send us an important message:\n 😊 Happy: Keep doing things that make you feel good. \n\n☹️ Sad: Something important in your life needs attention.\n\n😠 Angry: Stand up for yourself and set limits.\n\n🤢 Disgusted: Move away from something you don't like.\n\n😯 Surprised: Stop and pay attention for a moment.\n\n😨 Afraid: Run away from danger.\n \nAs children get older, they learn to identify lots of other emotions, like feeling excited, frustrated, proud, lonely, peaceful, guilty, or confused.",

Are you feeling angry?”*\n \nShare your own feelings with your child. For example: \n \n*“I know I feel the same way when I can’t go out when I want to.”*\n \nThis shows your child that it's okay to share their feelings. They will learn to recognise emotions in themselves and others too."
