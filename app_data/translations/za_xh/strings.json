  "Managing anger can be really difficult. Take a break when you feel you are getting angry at your children or someone else.\n\nGo somewhere else for 5 minutes to regain control of your emotions. If you have a safe outdoor space, go outside. You can get through this!": "Ukulawula umsindo kunobunzima kakhulu. Thatha ikhefu xa uziva usiba nomsindo ngakubantwana bakho okanye omnye umntu.\n\nYiya kwenye indawo kangangemizuzu emi- 5 uze ukwazi ukubuyisa ulawulo lwemvakalelo zakho zakho. Ukuba kunendawo ekhuselekileyo phandle, yiya khona. Uza kudlula kule nto!"
